I am a dedicated Software Engineer professional with four years of experience and currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree. Solid team player with a positive outlook on any project being worked on. Committed to maintaining deadlines on projects/updates to increase profitability and drive business results.

I'm currently developing my own blog site using React and Node.js to post any development resources which I couldn't find on other sites. I will post the link to that as soon as it's ready.
