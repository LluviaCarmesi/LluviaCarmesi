I am a dedicated Software Engineer professional with close to a half decade of experience and currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree. Solid team player with a positive outlook on any project being worked on. Committed to maintaining deadlines on projects/updates to increase profitability and drive business results.

I have developed an invoicer application using C#, React, and MySQL for personal understanding of building a fully fledged application. I am hosting it on my Raspberry Pi, but I'm going to implement some more functionality to make it more useful to me.

Once I'm done with that, I'll start developing my game in Unreal Engine.
