I am a dedicated Software Engineer professional with close to a half decade of experience and currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree. Solid team player with a positive outlook on any project being worked on. Committed to maintaining deadlines on projects/updates to increase profitability and drive business results.

I'm currently developing an invoicer application using C#, React, and MySQL for personal understanding of building a fully fledged application. Will probably host it on my Raspberry Pi.
